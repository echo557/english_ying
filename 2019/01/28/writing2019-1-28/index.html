<p>审题：family education vs school education<br>分析：<br>instead of  这个地方不对</p>
<ol>
<li><p>可以先让步，写family education得一些好处<br>增进亲子关系<br>更专注教育</p>
</li>
<li><p>写family education 的不足，只能通过学校教育才能做到<br>但是无法学到合作<br>也无法得到社会认可的学历<br>可能无法融入集体</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>学校教育不仅是教知识<br>还教与人相处<br>全面发展自身<br>become good member of society</p>
<p>结论：<br>这种做法弊大于利， 小孩还是要上学，家庭教育取代不了学校教育</p>
<p>The better educational condition nowadays makes it possible for children to study not only at schools, and there are increasing numbers of<br>parents prefer their children to study  at home and teach by themselves. There are many advantages that may bring to children, however<br>there is a wide concern that this phenomenon may have detrimental effects on their future development.</p>
<p>To begin with, one of multiple merits of teaching children at home is that parents can protect their children from bully. School violence is<br>common in school and enormous students have been bullied by others. Impact of bully leaves adverse influence on development of personality .<br>However, parents are able to eschew this miserable thing of their children by teaching them at home.<br>Moreover, by teaching children themselves, parents have chance to impose influence on their kids and enhance family bonds.<br>Children may imitate bad behaviors from  classmates in school, teaching at home would avoid this problem and kids will learn to behave well from<br>parents, which can also enhance the relationship between family members.</p>
<p>However, teaching children at home has demerits. One of them is that teaching requires professional skills. Parents may have enough knowledge to<br>teach their own children, while their teaching skills are not as mature as qualified teachers in school. Furthermore, children study at home may lose chances<br>to company with young peers.Cooperating skills and communication skills are quite important to people when they become society members. Parents may<br>be able to teach children these skills’ theory at home, but without applying in practice, there is no help for children’s future development.<br>At last, enormous time is needed for teaching. As a matter of fact, parents do not have sufficient time to teach their children, due to they have to work.</p>
<p>To sum up, teaching children at home has advantages and disadvantages. However, compared with two sides, it seems that disadvantages overweight advantages.<br>School is better place for kids to study and parents education is only a supplementary method.</p>
<p>For school children, their teachers have more influence on their intelligence and social development than their parents.<br>To what extent do you agree or disagree? 老师与父母对孩子的影响</p>
<h4 id="pressure"><a href="#pressure" class="headerlink" title="pressure"></a>pressure</h4><p>Children are experiencing more educational, social and commercial pressure. What are the causes?<br>What measures should be taken to reduce them? 孩子的压力</p>
<p>分析：pressure causes<br>Causes:<br>educational<br>social<br>commercial </p>
<p>Measures:<br>parents<br>Schools</p>
<h4 id="tools"><a href="#tools" class="headerlink" title="tools"></a>tools</h4><p>Students in school or university learn more from classes of teachers than other resources (e.g. the Internet or TV).<br>To what extent do you agree or disagree? 学校教育与其他教育方式</p>
<p>分析：<br>classes of teachers<br>vs<br>other resources</p>
<p>Agree<br>学校教育教育方法<br>其他教育作为补充</p>
<p>The traditional mode of teaching-learning is experiencing changes in many schools, with various multiple-media tools are introduced to the<br>class. Some people claim that students in schools or university can learn more when compared with these media tools, I partly agree with idea.</p>
<p>There is no denying that videos and movies can reach the aim of imparting knowledge to students and compared with teaching in schools, these teaching<br>aids can effectively attract children’s attention and make the process of learning more enjoyable. This is particularly important for those young children, who<br>have difficulty in concentration. However, learning from classes does not necessarily mean the class is boring and there are various ways to maintain learners’ enthusiasm,<br>such as doing role-plays in the class or adding interaction parts with teachers.</p>
<p>My arguments advocating universities also lie in other two aspects. Firstly, learning methods gives students more from teachers. Teachers have a lot of teaching<br>students how to directly get effective methods to get knowledge, while learning from medias needs students themselves to figure out the learning ways. For those<br>students who have weaker ability to find ways to learn, teachers is the wiser choice compared with other resources. Another advantage of university is it provide<br>a real environment for students to know how to communicate and cooperate with other people. When use other resource to learning,they have no chance to improve communication skills<br>and the cooperation skills  with persons face to face. They also may lead to worse influence on their future careers, from classes and teachers children<br>could prepare these skills to help them to achieve their goal in work place.</p>
<p>Overall, other resources such as TV and Internet can be adopted in classroom to assist teachers’ work. However, teachers can teach students more as they<br>can achieve better result in learning methods and contribute to children’s future development. </p>
<p>Some people think that it is effective for students to study in groups in school while others think that it is better to study alone.<br>Discuss both views and give your own opinion. 学习方式</p>
<p>分析： Group is better</p>
<p>Some people think that schools should stop teaching students by using books, because students find them boring and that children can learn from films, TV, videos games and computer instead.<br>To what extent do you agree or disagree?学校是否使用书籍</p>

<h4 id="Stage"><a href="#Stage" class="headerlink" title="Stage"></a>Stage</h4><p>In countries where there is a high rate of unemployment, most pupils should be offered only primary education. There is no point in offering secondary education to those who have no hope of finding a job.<br>To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement? 中学教育 </p>
<p>分析： disagree<br>advocate<br>equal opportunity for education<br>A children who has just graduated from primary school is without judgment ability about their future career.<br>Deprivation of educational rights<br>too early to judge children can not find jobs, their future<br>potential<br>job such as service industry which have less requirements of reading skills is<br>High degree make it possible for people to find jobs<br>but for other types pf job need higher degree and more complicated skills , education is quite important.</p>
<p>Some people think that the qualities a person needs to become successful in today’s world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution.<br>To what extent do you agree or disagree?大学教育的目的<br>分析：disagree</p>
<p>Some people think that young people should spend more of their free time at home with their families and spend less time entertaining outside. However, others think differently.<br>Discuss both views and give your own opinion. 未成年的教育</p>
<p>Some people think that schools should select their pupils according to their academic ability. Others believe that young people with different abilities should be educated together.<br>Discuss both views and give your own opinion.分班教育</p>
<p>Some educationalists think that the program of international exchange visits would benefit all teenage school students.<br>Do you think the benefit of such a program overweigh its disadvantage? 青少年国际交换项目</p>
