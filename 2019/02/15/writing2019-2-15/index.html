        <h4 id="Family-amp-City"><a href="#Family-amp-City" class="headerlink" title="Family &amp; City"></a>Family &amp; City</h4><ol>
<li><p>In the old times,it’s common to see that several family generations live in one house, this type of mode helps families live through starvation times and enhance family members’ cohesion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Due to the raising of citizens’ living standard, they are hunting for having more independent and  more personal spaces than previous day.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If people could burden to buy new houses or rent departments, they would prefer to build their own family and enjoy their private lifestyle.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is believed that convenient massive transportation and communication makes it possible for people to move frequently.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Taking China for example, many young people move from rural area to urban city in order to find a good job and make a good living.</p>
</li>
<li><p>With family structure change, it seems that family members bonds tend to weaker than previous days, which contribute to serials problems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On one aspect, the elderly need care and attention, but in fact it seems it’s hard for them to get that, due to their adult offspring are too busy with works or personal businesses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Without helping from parents, those young parents from coin family need to tackle with all living problems by themselves, especially taking care of their next generation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Core family tends to become popular family mode in society nowadays, but we also need to pay attention to its possible side effects of this trend.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In many countries, family’s scale is decreasing due to more and more people are likely to live alone or be single.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Education"><a href="#Education" class="headerlink" title="Education"></a>Education</h4><ol>
<li><p>It is believed that, the purpose of education is to cultivate people as good members for society.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In many countries,government would afford parts of expenditure or assist fund for schools.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People look forward to graduates could make contributions to society.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Well-educated people could well serve society via knowledges and skills from education.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People believe that the purpose of education is to cultivate ability person for the development of society.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From the point view of students, the purpose of education is to realize their dreams and ambitions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is no denying that no all countries are able to provide free and high quality compulsory education for children.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If people could aware of that hard study in schools would let them contribute to  better life in the future, they would pay more enthusiasm in studies. </p>
</li>
<li><p>There are two purpose of education, one is prosperity of society, the other is realizing personal dreams.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If we overemphasized the benefits bring to society via education, people may lose the study enthusiasm.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Career"><a href="#Career" class="headerlink" title="Career"></a>Career</h4><ol>
<li><p>In today’s knowledge age society, science and techniques are developing rapidly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The first cause is that science is more difficult than other subjects, which means students could achieve science degree unless they invest more efforts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Becoming a chemist or physicist generally need students widen their theory courses and spend many years working in laboratory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because the process is long and boring, it may prevent many young people to select science as their major.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It seems that science major graduates are unpopularity in job market.</p>
</li>
<li><p>They may have professional basis of theoretical knowledge, but this can not satisfy employer’s job requirements, due to employer prefer to hire employees with practical skills.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Compared with math major students, a graduate who has accounting certificates is seemed more easily to find jobs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because people are becoming more and more realistic, it’s no doubt that enrollment rate of science students is decreasing gradually.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is well-known to people, society’s productive power rely on the development of techniques,<br>and in turn technological developing is built upon scientific basic theory research.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>If there were not sufficient people doing science research, technological creation will be prevented, country would lose its competition in the long term.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Criminal"><a href="#Criminal" class="headerlink" title="Criminal"></a>Criminal</h4><ol>
<li><p>It seems that crimes can not be estimated, due to it’s existed in every country, whatever we should make great efforts to fight it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In order to estimate crimes, we have to find out the root causes and solutions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In some emerging nations, gap between rich and poor is extending rapidly, which is caused various economical and violent crimes occur.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gap between rich and poor is still the main criminal cause in some regions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Research shows due to genes and growing environment, a  portion of people have antisocial characters in the country, but it’s hard to recognize and prevent them doing crazy behaves.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the contrary, there are many measures to reduce crimes effectively.</p>
</li>
<li><p>These heavy crimes must be punished hardly, so that the people who want to do crimes can be terrified.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Due to many criminal behaviors are caused by people who are in shortage of law conscious or hard to survive, we need to provide education for prisoners and teach them practical skills during their prison time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="City-problems"><a href="#City-problems" class="headerlink" title="City problems"></a>City problems</h4><ol>
<li><p>Because urban population is too many and the land resource is limited, which lead to living house shortage problems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If some companies and staffs moved to countryside, the requirements of living house in urban cities would be reduced, as a result house pricing would be declined.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The number of people take cars go to work in cities will be reduced,so as the traffic conjunctions. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The advantage of moving company to countryside is not only developing local economy but also reducing gap between countryside and city.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People need waste a lot time on the way to work place that may make them exhausted and have bad mood.</p>
</li>
<li><p>However,strategy of transferring companies to countryside may bring some problems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Employees may not want to move to rural areas, because once they do it, they are no longer able to enjoy high quality education resources, medical services and entertainment facilities in cities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The infrastructures in countryside are relatively backward than city’s and the lives  are inconvenient either.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Science"><a href="#Science" class="headerlink" title="Science"></a>Science</h4><ol>
<li><p>There is no denying that computer technology promote social productive forces rapidly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People are no longer need to go to library to look for reference books but to get information via online database. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Using emails and mobile phones make it possible for people cooperating and communicating with each other is more effective and convenient. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Other people are worried about that techniques may make things more complicated and inconvenient.   </p>
</li>
<li><p>Taking genetically modified food for example, their safety is uncertainty yet so they may bring some health risks to humans.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using massive agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizer gain corn’s production, which provide sufficient food for growing populations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Radiation generated by electronic devices would be harmful to people’s health, what’s more there’s no effective methods to avoid it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is another controversial problem is that with widely usage of chemical fertilizer and pesticides, its remaining chemical substance would pollute soil and underground water.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I believe that humans’ better future depends on science and technology’s further development.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If we could pay more attention to environmental protection and human health when pursuing advanced technology then technology was able to serve human better.</p>
</li>
