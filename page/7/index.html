        <p>Mass car ownership in many cities has become a concern to many people. How should we change<br>the situation if you think it leads to undesirable consequences.</p>
<p>Topic:<br>Mass car ownership clearly has a number of undesirable consequences for people’s health and for the<br>environment generally.</p>
<p>This essay will offer some possible solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>One possible approach is to make cars expensive to own and use, for example, by taxing them at the point of<br>purchase or annually through a road tax.<br>Certain types of car use, for instance, short journeys within already congested cities,<br>can also be discouraged through road pricing strategies.</p>
<p>However, these punitive measures alone are unlikely to have a major impact unless alternative means<br>of transport are available.</p>
<p>A more effective method that governments could take in busy cities is to encourage the use of public transport.</p>
<p>This means that transport options have to be plentiful, convenient and reliable and people need to be<br>able to afford them.<br>Besides, governments should run campaigns to encourage people to be less dependent on their cars.</p>
<p>A more environmentally should option is to create a network of cycle lanes and other facilities for cyclists,<br>such as safe weather-proof shelters for parking bicycles.</p>
<p>This has the additional advantage of encouraging people to keep fit while allowing them  the flexibility<br>of autonomous travel.</p>
<p>Cities in the Netherlands, which have relatively high rates of cycling, has shown how this can work.</p>
<p>To sum up, the trend towards rising car ownership and use needs to be changed. People should be encouraged<br>to use other means of transport and investment in practical alternatives is what is needed above all.</p>

        <h4 id="Love-City"><a href="#Love-City" class="headerlink" title="Love City"></a>Love City</h4><p>What it is famous for:<br>–Chengdu, is famous for its low speed living environment, comfortable city to live and foodies heaven.<br>It has so many wide-famous attractions, like, hot pat, pandas, Sichuan local plays, majiang, and so on<br>It’s just a charming and awesome city. If you like city lives as well, there also have many bars you can<br>choice, like the most famous bar in Chengdu named Languifang.</p>
<p>Why you think it’s a beautiful city：<br>–I love Chengdu and I really happy to live here. Chengdu is so beautiful and vibrant at the same time.<br>This city is always something going on in the city, it’s a city that never sleep.And it has amazing restaurants<br>here, which is such a big attraction for a foodie like me. And moreover, I like the culture and lifestyles here.<br>Suitable, low speed living lives, hospitable citizens are made feel comfortable, it’s a city kept its open house.<br>I guess that’s why I lived here for so many years. So, that’s the beautiful city I like, thanks for listening.</p>
<p>Where it is and how you knew it：</p>
<p>–As for where Chengdu is, well, I guess everybody knows about the city, it’s the provincial city of Sichuan province.<br>It’s located in the middle southwest of China. I study and work here for nearly 10 years, I know it from my parents<br>.They say Chengdu is a big city where is fun and have many opportunities. It’s a good place to achieve my dream.</p>
<p>Do you think having too many tourists is a positive thing for historical attractions?</p>
<p>–It’s definitely not a positive thing. I mean, I know some people may say that having tons of tourists is a good thing<br>for the frame of the attraction, and also it brings good income to the area, and part of money can be used to preserve<br>the attraction. But, when it comes to “too many” tourists, it becomes a burden. Especially for historical sites, they<br>are so fragile, too many people will damage the place</p>
<h4 id="Law"><a href="#Law" class="headerlink" title="Law"></a>Law</h4><p>简单开头，避免过度铺垫<br>Good law<br>– Ok, to be honest, it’ hard to think of a good law within a short time. uhmmm, the first thing came to my  mind was the<br>“”</p>

<p>– Well, I want to describe a book, I recently read whose name is “How to read a book”. I don’t know who has written it.<br>I knew it from one of my best friend, she has recommended it to me after she had read it. She sayed the book is very helpful<br>for teaching people to read different kinds of reading materials. Well, the book shares some methods for people to read. It contains<br>: Firstly, reading levels, including basic reading and scanning reading, we need to learn how to become a clever reader.<br>Secondly, the third reading level. People learn to analyze reading, including to learn the deep meaning from the book,<br>how to judge a book.how to read fictions or  literary books. Thirdly,how to read different kinds of books, the tool books,<br>literary books, science books or magazines. The last one, is how to get themes and artistic of the books</p>
