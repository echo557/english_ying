        <h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>口语使用经验的积累<br>练习不可少<br>思维方式+表达 = 语言<br>所有的口语对话能力都基于大量思维经验所产生的思维惯性<br>自然，真实，合理，逻辑</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn English way of thinking </li>
<li>Try to think in English(start small)</li>
<li>Don’t try to translate everything from your month language</li>
<li>Native English speaker’s way of thinking</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Part1"><a href="#Part1" class="headerlink" title="Part1"></a>Part1</h4><p>Do you often use a map?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah I do. I don’t have a good sense of direction. I will get lost if I don’t<br>have my google map with me. I could say that I rely on my GPS app to get to different<br>places in the city. I can’t live without maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who taught you to use a map?</p>
<p>-My parents taught me how to use a paper map who I was little. They trained me a lot by<br>letting me find the way myself, using a map. And the electronic maps nowadays are very easy<br>to handle, so just figured out myself.</p>
<p>Did you save money when you were young?</p>
<p>-I think I did, sometimes. I mean, when I was little, my parents would give me pocket money each week for<br>things like snacks. But that wouldn’t be enough if I want to buy something more expensive.<br>So， from time to time, I would put the extra money in my piggy bank and save the money for something bigger.</p>
<p>Do you like to send expensive gifts?</p>
<p>-Sometimes. I send expensive gifts, according </p>
<p>If someone wants to draw a painting of you, will you agree?</p>
<ul>
<li>Uhmm, sure, why not, I mean, I might feel very surprised and flattered that someone<br>wants to draw a painting of me, because I’m nobody. But I won’t say no to that. It’ll be really cool<br>to have a portrait of myself.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Part3"><a href="#Part3" class="headerlink" title="Part3"></a>Part3</h4><p>What can people do to protect  their equipment from technical problems?</p>
<p>-Firstly, you need to be very careful while using the equipment. Always follow the instruction. The more careful<br>you are, the longer it will  last. And then, make sure you get the warranty for the equipment you buy,<br>so that even if it breaks, you will have technician take care the problem for you for free. So I guess,<br>those are the things you could do.</p>
<p>What is required to be a good public speaker?</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to be a good public speaker, first, you need to have a beautiful voice, and the ability to speak<br>clearly and articulate your thoughts, that’s the first thing to make people pay attention to you when you give the<br>talk, and second, you need to be appealing to your audience, that is to say, you need to be charismatic (有魅力的)，<br>expressive （善于表达的), passionate and motivational(有启发的), you have to be able to engage with your audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why would people spend a lot of time learning one skill?</p>
<ul>
<li>Uhmmm, people spend lots of time learning one skill because, firstly, it always requires a lot of time and effort to<br>master one skill (拿下某项技能), you have to keep practicing: and secondly, it gives people a sense of achievement and<br>satisfaction to spend much time and effort on one thing and eventually become an expert on this thing. Our society praise<br>people like that . And finally, through a huge amount of practice, it might become a habit, and people spend tons of<br>time on keeping habit.</li>

<p>The government should have less control of media.</p>
<p>New technologies and ways of buying and selling are transforming the<br>life of consumers. What is your opinion on the issue</p>
<p>确定话题范围： 时尚与购物类话题<br>确定讨论对象： online shopping </p>
<p>influence<br>Analyze the influence of</p>
<p>In many countries, buying products online has become a mainstream activity.<br>While some people have concerns towards this trend, I think that it leads to several desirable results.</p>
<p>The development of online shopping has meant that the Internet has become a<br>world-wide retail market: exotic foods, art works, rare books, adventure holidays and the<br>list is endless. Products that were once available to a few people living in big cities<br>can now be bought by those living in small  towns.</p>
<p>Additionally, buyers can have more control over the process. Prices comparison websites make it<br>easier to find bargains. Shopping can be done at any time of the day or night, and<br>shoppers can browser for the product as long as they like without pressure from<br>sale assistants. This means that shoppers can potentially become more astute and knowledgeable<br>about the products that they are buying. Because of the greater competition involved in<br>trading within a large market, sellers may have to improve the quality of their products.</p>
<p>However, that is not means that shopping online brings about no problems. One of the biggest concerns is safety.<br>With the increasing virus threats ans well-trained hackers, online deals are well exposed to all kinds of risks and losses,<br>for example, the wide-spread problem of identity theft.Therefore, when making the most of the desirable changes brought by<br>technology, we should be aware of its potential downsides and find a way to minimize the<br>negative impacts of them.</p>
<p>Therefore, experience suggests that online shopping has transformed modern life.<br>Consumers today not only have wider access to goods but also have greater access information<br>and more control over how they shop.</p>
