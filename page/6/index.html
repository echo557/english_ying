<p>Background: Economic progress<br>Method1: In recent years, thanks to the rapid economic growth, people in many countries are living richer lifestyles than before.<br>Method2: In many countries governments make great effort to stimulate economic growth by implementing various policies.</p>
<p>While many governments think the most important goal is to develop the economy, some people disagree and they believe that<br>other factors should also be emphasized./ There is a debate about whether economic success is the most important to a country.</p>
<p>Opinion 1:<br>living  conditions,  improve people’s living standard, high quality<br>governments: tax, improve welfare,infrastructure<br>There is no doubt that a strong economy can improve people’s living standard, proving them with…/ making it possible for people to buy…</p>
<p>There is no doubt that a strong economy can improve people’s living standard, providing them with various kinds of high-quality and<br>affordable products including food, clothes or even luxuries. It can also increase the government’s tax revenues, which can be invested in<br>public services and people can enjoy better education, health care, transportation, etc. Economic strength can raise a country’s status and<br>increase its influence in the international community as well, because this country can play a greater role in solving international problems.</p>
<p>Opinion 2:<br>Environment are important: benefit when environment good; harmful when environment bad<br>Gap between rich and poor, crime rate rise, unjustifiable , unfair</p>
<p>However, other people argue that apart from economic success, a country also needs to make progress in other aspects. First of all, the environment<br>should be protected and pollution be controlled. If a country excessively exploits natural resources and damages the ecological environment, the economic<br>development would be unsustainable and people would pay a price for it. Also, it is important for the government to build a society with equity and justice,<br>as the purpose of economic development is to ensure a better life for all people. In a country where the gap between rich and poor people becomes wider as<br>a result of economic progress, a series of social problems would occur, leading to instability and chaos of the society.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it is reasonable for the government to place high value on economic success, which can bring many substantial benefits to the country and its<br>people. Meanwhile, other factors such as environment protection and social justice should also be emphasized, as there are associated with people’s well-being<br>and the country’s long-term prosperity.</p>

She is the first person came to my ming when I saw this topic,<br>and she is definitely one of the smartest people I know. We’ve know each other since high school,<br>she was my desk mate for two years, we were really close to each other.<br>In terms of when and where I wet her for the first time, I remember my first day at high school, I was feeling very shy<br>and nervous to see all those new faces. And Xin was sitting next to me, suddenly she started talking to me, like an old friend.<br>So we just got talking, and we hit off immediately. I felt very comfortable in front of her.<br>And as for what kind of person she is? Well, she is very smart, first of all. You can tell once she starts talking to you. And then,<br>she is very friendly, she likes to make friends with people. She is very outgoing and sociable.She gets along well with everyone.<br>And what else, she’s very fun to be with, she’s got a great sense of humor and very witty. You will never feel bored when you are with her.<br>She is really good company.  </p>
<p>And the reason why I think she’s really intelligent is that she has very strong inter-personal skills.<br>She has ability to talk with different people and know what to talk with them.</p>
<p>So, yeh, that’s my best friend, thanks for listening</p>

I think it’s English.<br>I started to learn English from High School, but only just eximinations , we had not chance to do other things<br>with English, such as communication or do further search of academic subject by English.</p>
<p>In terms of when I realized it was important was after I graduated from school. I was employed by a foreign company,<br>we need to use English to communication with colleagues by emails or meeting. I need to make people know how to<br>work smoothly by English. </p>

        <p>Mass car ownership in many cities has become a concern to many people. How should we change<br>the situation if you think it leads to undesirable consequences.</p>
<p>Topic:<br>Mass car ownership clearly has a number of undesirable consequences for people’s health and for the<br>environment generally.</p>
<p>This essay will offer some possible solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>One possible approach is to make cars expensive to own and use, for example, by taxing them at the point of<br>purchase or annually through a road tax.<br>Certain types of car use, for instance, short journeys within already congested cities,<br>can also be discouraged through road pricing strategies.</p>
<p>However, these punitive measures alone are unlikely to have a major impact unless alternative means<br>of transport are available.</p>
<p>A more effective method that governments could take in busy cities is to encourage the use of public transport.</p>
<p>This means that transport options have to be plentiful, convenient and reliable and people need to be<br>able to afford them.<br>Besides, governments should run campaigns to encourage people to be less dependent on their cars.</p>
<p>A more environmentally should option is to create a network of cycle lanes and other facilities for cyclists,<br>such as safe weather-proof shelters for parking bicycles.</p>
<p>This has the additional advantage of encouraging people to keep fit while allowing them  the flexibility<br>of autonomous travel.</p>
<p>Cities in the Netherlands, which have relatively high rates of cycling, has shown how this can work.</p>
<p>To sum up, the trend towards rising car ownership and use needs to be changed. People should be encouraged<br>to use other means of transport and investment in practical alternatives is what is needed above all.</p>
