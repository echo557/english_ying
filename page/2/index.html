<p>The government should have less control of media.</p>
<p>New technologies and ways of buying and selling are transforming the<br>life of consumers. What is your opinion on the issue</p>
<p>确定话题范围： 时尚与购物类话题<br>确定讨论对象： online shopping </p>
<p>influence<br>Analyze the influence of</p>
<p>In many countries, buying products online has become a mainstream activity.<br>While some people have concerns towards this trend, I think that it leads to several desirable results.</p>
<p>The development of online shopping has meant that the Internet has become a<br>world-wide retail market: exotic foods, art works, rare books, adventure holidays and the<br>list is endless. Products that were once available to a few people living in big cities<br>can now be bought by those living in small  towns.</p>
<p>Additionally, buyers can have more control over the process. Prices comparison websites make it<br>easier to find bargains. Shopping can be done at any time of the day or night, and<br>shoppers can browser for the product as long as they like without pressure from<br>sale assistants. This means that shoppers can potentially become more astute and knowledgeable<br>about the products that they are buying. Because of the greater competition involved in<br>trading within a large market, sellers may have to improve the quality of their products.</p>
<p>However, that is not means that shopping online brings about no problems. One of the biggest concerns is safety.<br>With the increasing virus threats ans well-trained hackers, online deals are well exposed to all kinds of risks and losses,<br>for example, the wide-spread problem of identity theft.Therefore, when making the most of the desirable changes brought by<br>technology, we should be aware of its potential downsides and find a way to minimize the<br>negative impacts of them.</p>
<p>Therefore, experience suggests that online shopping has transformed modern life.<br>Consumers today not only have wider access to goods but also have greater access information<br>and more control over how they shop.</p>
